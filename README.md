# FileFrog
Searches for folders in the current Directory and 'hops' into whichever it chooses. 
If it doesn't see a folder, it will instead 'hop' upwards. 

## Why?
I had an idea, and it wouldn't leave me alone. This Definitely has the potential to be extremely annoying if a few lines are changed, so have fun with that.
I think the initial idea was a sort of hide and seek involving tracking down and stopping this script.

## Contingency Plans
If it gets out and you can't stop it, write a script that deletes any file with the name "ex2.sh". Even moving the file unexpectedly may stop it.
